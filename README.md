# Snack Collector Game – Processing Arcade Game

## 🎮 Overview
This is a level-based 2D arcade game developed using the Processing IDE (Java-based). The player controls a character who must collect falling snacks while avoiding trash and enemy crows. The game gets progressively harder with each level, increasing both the speed and number of falling items.

## 🕹️ Game Features
- **Player Movement**: Use arrow keys to move left, right, up, and down.
- **Food Collection**: Catch falling snacks to increase score.
- **Avoid Obstacles**:
  - **Trash**: Reduces score when collected.
  - **Crows**: Deduct lives or cause game over on collision.
- **Multiple Levels**: Difficulty increases with each level (items fall faster).
- **Screen Transitions**: Includes start screen, gameplay, and game-over screens.
- **Score & Life Tracking**: Displays current score and remaining lives.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Processing IDE (Java-based)**
- Object-Oriented Programming (for managing player, items, enemies)
- Frame-based animation and game loop logic

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Collision Detection  
- Game State Management  
- Custom Classes and Encapsulation  
- Real-time Input Handling

## 📂 File Structure
- `MainGame.pde` – Main file controlling game flow and setup
- `Player.pde` – Handles player logic and movement
- `Food.pde` – Handles food items
- `Trash.pde` – Handles trash behavior
- `handGlove.pde` – Enemy logic and movement
- `ScreenManager.pde` – Controls screen transitions

## ✅ How to Run
